          <p>
            I’m a product leader and early-stage operator with over a decade of
            experience building technology that improves lives — especially in
            healthcare. I’ve launched products from 0→1, grown teams, led client
            implementations, and advised startups across biopharma, medtech,
            payer, and provider ecosystems.
          </p>
          <p>
            My career has taken me from enterprise EHR deployments to founding
            and scaling a healthtech startup, to leading product strategy at a
            prestigious academic medical center. Along the way, I’ve also run a
            successful consulting practice, generating over $1M in revenue while
            helping clients launch and scale mission-driven products.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive at the intersection of strategy, execution, and empathy —
            especially when working with brilliant, kind people on hard problems
            that matter. I bring energy, curiosity, and a deep sense of
            ownership to everything I take on.
          </p>

            I see through the eyes of an idealist but act with the discipline of
            a pragmatist. Barriers become catalysts that empower me to solve
            otherwise unarticulated problems.

            <a href="https://fightforfair.org" target="_blank"
              >Fight for Fair</a
            >
            is a new nonprofit aimed at helping patients fight back against
            exorbitant medical and pharmacy bills by negotiating for fair and
            transparent prices.

          <h3>Earn to Give</h3>
          <p>
            I founded
            <a href="https://earntogive.org" target="_blank">Earn to Give</a>
            out of a desire to make charitable giving more fun and
            cost-efficient. Organized as a 501(c)(3) sponsoring organization of
            Donor Advised Funds, Earn to Give is positioned to disrupt the DAF
            status quo of high fees, initial deposit requirements, limited
            investment options, and lack of resources dedicated to helping
            people identify causes and charities that matter most to them.
          </p>

          <h3>The Stoic Fellowship</h3>
          <p>
            In 2016, I co-founded
            <a href="https://www.stoicfellowship.com" target="_blank"
              >The Stoic Fellowship</a
            >, a multinational 501(c)(3) nonprofit that seeks to build, connect,
            and foster communities of people interested in an ancient Greek
            philosophy known as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank"
              >Stoicism</a
            >. To date, we've helped build communities in over 100 locations
            spanning every continent. I serve as President and board member.

          <h3>Compass Foundry</h3>
          <p>
            I founded
            <a href="https://www.compassfoundry.com" target="_blank"
              >Compass Foundry</a
            >
            with a desire to help early stage entrepreneurs bootstrap profitable
            tech businesses with as little resistance as possible. The
            unfortunate first step for many founders today is to hire a dev shop
            to build an often unvetted idea for $50K+ or give away half their
            equity to hire a technical co-founder who may or may not share their
            passion for the idea. I figured there had to be a better way.
            Compass Foundry offers early stage founders an alternative.

          <h2 class="major">Past Work & Projects</h2>

          <h3>MyMeds</h3>
          <p>
            For five years, I led the product team at a health tech startup
            based in Minneapolis called
            <a href="https://www.my-meds.com" target="_blank">MyMeds</a>. MyMeds
            aims to improve health outcomes and reduce the overall cost of care
            by improving medication adherence. As Head of Product, I focused my
            energy at the intersection of our business strategy, technical
            vision, and user experience. I remain involved with the team as a
            stratgic advisor.
          </p>

          <h3>Fix Broadway</h3>
          <p>
            There used to be a 4-lane undivided street in NE Minneapolis called
            Broadway where the lanes were too narrow, crashes were common,
            pedestrians feared for their lives, and cyclists who rode it must
            have had a death wish. I worked with a task force of about 60 people
            under the monicker Fix Broadway to create improvements. We surveyed
            thousands of residents and commuters, met with city and county
            officials to discuss concerns, and co-designed solutions. In late
            2019, our collaborative efforts culminated in the successful
            repaving and re-striping of the street. What was once one of the
            most dangerous thoroughfares in Minneapolis is now a more modern,
            safe, and efficient passage.
          </p>
          <h3>Accel.MN</h3>
          <p>
            Accel.MN was a totally free program for entrepreneurs to refine
            their ideas and be prompted into action in a collaborative setting.
            It was like a "pre-accelerator", or a program that would prepare
            people for a more traditional accelerator seeking to invest seed
            funding in exchange for equity in a startup. The mission of Accel.MN
            was to accelerate the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Minnesota by
            improving the collective education, network, and support of
            early-stage entrepreneurs while promoting a positive startup
            culture. In addition to participating in the first cohort, I served
            as a founding board member.
          </p>

          <h3>North Labs</h3>
          <p>
            I co-founded
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/15245045/" target="_blank"
              >North Labs</a
            >
            in 2016 with
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/collingraves" target="_blank"
              >Collin Graves</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/motterstatter" target="_blank"
              >Matt Otterstatter</a
            >. Our mission was simple: provide non-technical founders with
            software development resources at a fraction of the cost that
            agencies and freelancers charge in today's market. To do this, I
            built relationships with over a dozen fully-vetted offshore firms
            while offering product management and technical architecture
            in-house. As with many of the companies we advised, North Labs
            pivoted in late 2017 to meet more lucrative demands with AWS
            consulting. With the pivot (and admittedly my lack of AWS
            knowledge), I decided to sell my ownership in North Labs and pursue
            new projects.
          </p>
          <h3>Eat and Greet</h3>
          <p>
            Eat and Greet flipped the traditional restaurant experience on its
            head. People generally go to restaurants with friends, family, or
            colleagues. With Eat and Greet, six individuals RSVPed to save a
            seat at a table ahead of time and left with a full belly and five
            new friends. These experiences were great for people who were new to
            a city and wanted to make new connections while trying local
            restaurants. The idea was in MVP stage as I tested concepts with a
            Meetup community. If successful, I planned to build it into a full
            product with the mission of connecting people hungry for food,
            friendship, and thought-provoking conversation.

              >picking up traction</a
            >
            across the nation, and I wanted to create a forum for people to meet
            in real life and share resources and insights. Core to this ethos is
            that our time is the most precious finite resource. Thus we do
            everything we can to create a life for ourselves in which we have
            the freedom to choose how we spend that time, even if that means
            attaining a 50%+ or greater savings rate by living significantly
            below our means.

          <h3>Stoic Daily</h3>

            I've found long-term travel to be an efficient promoter of rapid
            self-improvement. It's helped me identify and correct bad habits,
            prioritize life goals, and more fully empathize with people of
            backgrounds radically different from my own.

              some of the best beer. Mission accomplished!
