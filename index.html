						<span class="image main"><img src="images/world-map.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>I call myself a method scholar (borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" target="_blank">method acting</a>), in that I spend my time immersed
							in a specific discipline or lifestyle for a predetermined period of time.</p>
						<p>In the past few years, you could have caught me running
							product for a small health tech startup, living as an
							itinerary-free vagabond traveling for months on end, day
							trading multi-leg derivatives, reading countless books on
							ancient Stoic philosophy, or in an airport en route to a
							client health system. I've found that this deliberate,
							multi-disciplinary approach to life facilitates authentic,
							solution-oriented thinking and a deep sense of
							understanding-driven empathy.</p>
						<p>In my <a href ="pdf/Guggenbuehl-Resume_2022.pdf" target="_blank">work</a>, I see through the
							eyes of an idealist but act with the discipline of a
							pragmatist. Barriers become catalysts that empower me to
							solve otherwise unarticulated problems.</p>

				<!-- Projects -->
					<article id="projects">
						
						<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
							<p>I like building products that help people live better lives.</p>
								<h3>The Stoic Fellowship</h3>
									<p>In 2016, I co-founded <a href="https://www.stoicfellowship.com" target="_blank">The Stoic Fellowship</a>, a multinational 501(c)(3) nonprofit that seeks to
										build, connect, and foster communities of people interested in an ancient Greek philosophy known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank">Stoicism</a>. To date, we've helped build communities
										in over 75 cities spanning every continent. I serve as President and board member.
								<h3>Compass Foundry</h3>
									<p>I founded <a href="https://www.compassfoundry.com" target="_blank">Compass Foundry</a> with a desire to help early stage entrepreneurs bootstrap profitable tech businesses with as little resistance as possible. The unfortunate first step for many founders today is to hire a dev shop to build a largely unvetted idea for $50K+ or give away half their equity to hire a technical co-founder who may or may not share their passion for the idea. I figured there had to be a better way. Compass Foundry offers early stage founders an alternative.
										<br />
										<br />
										With <strong>Compass Consult</strong>, founders meet with a product expert to determine the most efficient way to test market assumptions, find early customers, and talk to potential users to make sure they build the right thing.
										<br />
										<br />
										With <strong>Compass Create</strong>, founders can work with a team of software engineers, product designers, finance experts, and more to build their ideas into reality. Or for those who have a team selected already, we're happy to continue providing strategic consultation.
										<br />
										<br />
										With <strong>Compass Capital</strong>, technical and product experts help select entrepreneurs build a digital product for zero up front costs in exchange for
										a revenue sharing agreement. This aligns incentives, as we don't take a cent until the founders are making money themselves.
									</p>

								<h2>Past Projects</h2>
							</br>
							<h3>MyMeds</h3>
										<p>For five years, I led the product team at a health tech startup based in Minneapolis called <a href ="https://www.my-meds.com" target="_blank">MyMeds</a>. MyMeds aims to improve health outcomes and reduce the overall cost of care by improving medication adherence.
											As Head of Product, I focused my energy at the intersection of our business strategy, technical vision, and user experience. I remain involved with the team as a stratgic advisor.</p>
							
								<h3>Fix Broadway</h3>
										<p>There used to be a 4-lane undivided street in NE Minneapolis called Broadway where the lanes were too narrow, crashes were common, pedestrians feared for their lives, and cyclists who rode it must have had a death wish. I worked with a task force of about
												60 people under the monicker <a href="https://www.fixbroadway.org" target="_blank">Fix Broadway</a> to create improvements. We surveyed thousands of residents and commuters, met with city and county officials to discuss concerns, and co-designed solutions. In late 2019, our collaborative efforts culminated in the successful repaving and restriping of the street. What was once one of the most dangerous thoroughfares in Minneapolis is now a more modern, safe, and efficient passage.
										</p>
								<h3>Accel.MN</h3>
									<p>Accel.MN was a totally free program for entrepreneurs to refine their ideas and be prompted into action in a collaborative setting. It was like a "pre-accelerator", or a program that would prepare people for a more traditional accelerator seeking to invest seed funding in exchange for equity in a startup.
										The mission of Accel.MN was to accelerate the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Minnesota by improving the collective education, network, and support of early-stage entrepreneurs while promoting a positive startup culture. In addition to participating in the first cohort, I served as a founding board member.
								<h3>North Labs</h3>
									<p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/15245045/" target="_blank">North Labs</a> in 2016 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/collingraves" target="_blank">Collin Graves</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/motterstatter" target="_blank">Matt Otterstatter</a>.
										Our mission was simple: provide non-technical founders with software development resources at a fraction of the cost that agencies and freelancers charge in today's market. To do this, I built relationships with over a dozen fully-vetted offshore firms while offering product
									management and technical architecture in-house. As with many of the companies we advised, North Labs pivoted in late 2017 to meet more lucrative demands with AWS consulting. With the pivot (and admittedly my lack of AWS knowledge), I decided to sell my ownership in North Labs and pursue new projects.</p>
								<h3>Eat and Greet</h3>
									<p>Eat and Greet flipped the traditional restaurant experience on its head. People generally go to restaurants with friends, family, or colleagues. With Eat and Greet, six individuals RSVPed to save a seat at a table ahead of time and left with a full belly and five new friends.
											These experiences were great for people who were new to a city and wanted to make new connections while trying local restaurants. The idea was in MVP stage as I tested concepts with a Meetup community. If successful, I planned to build it into a full product with the mission of connecting people hungry for food, friendship, and thought-provoking conversation.
									</p>
								<h3>MNonFIRE</h3>
									<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-on-FIRE/" target=_"blank">MNonFIRE</a> is a community I founded for people who aspire to FIRE, or become financially independent and retire early. The FIRE movement is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/style/fire-financial-independence-retire-early.html" target="_blank">picking up traction</a> across the
											nation, and I wanted to create a forum for people to meet in real life and share resources and insights. Core to this ethos is that our time is the most precious finite resource. Thus we do everything we can to create a life for ourselves in which we have the freedom to choose how we spend that time, even if that means attaining a 50%+ or greater savings rate by
											living significantly below our means.
									</p>
								<h3>Stoic Daily</h3>
									<p>I launched a micro tech project with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zfoster45" target="_blank">Zach Foster</a>,
										my close friend and travel buddy. <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stoic-new-tab/egflmnkcgdbljjogbonkpahhaddkgcgp?hl=en" target="_blank">Stoic Daily</a> is a Chrome extension that changes "new tabs" into beautiful natural settings overlayed by a quote from a Stoic author.

					<article id="travel">
						<h2 class="major">Travel</h2>
						<p>I've found long-term travel to be an efficient promoter of rapid self-improvement.
						It's helped me identify and correct bad habits, priorize life goals, and more fully
						empathize with people of backgrounds radically different from my own.
